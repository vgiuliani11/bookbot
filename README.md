# bookbot
BookBot is a project from the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) development course. It aims to teach how to access a file a generate useful data from it, by using a book in the public domain (Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley) and using Python functions to extract data and generate a report from the data retrieved.

## Instructions
- A copy of the [book's text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt) must be included in the file `./books/frankenstein.txt`
- Run the file main.py (`python3 main.py`)

## Expected Result
After running the file, a "book report" should be printed in the console, like as follows:

--- Begin report of books/frankenstein.txt ---\
